Ideas:
  * Make Incremental Game about production and demand
  * Worlds Demands grow or shrink according to players production
  * Each 'reset' adds production to world, making it cheaper to buy sell
  * Each play has a set amount of bot slots, forcing to specialize 

Roadmap:
  * give secondary currency for 'resets'
  * buy perks for secondary currency
  * more needs
  * more bots
  * export save
  * come up with cool names and tooltips
  * restructure code for more streamlined mechanics
  * figure out how to update saves when changes are made
